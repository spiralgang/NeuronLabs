# Build Artifacts

This directory contains build artifacts and compiled applications.

## Directory Structure

- `apk/` - Android APK files and packages (currently empty - non-functional APKs removed)
- `releases/` - Release builds organized by version

## APK Status

The APK files have been removed as they were non-functional. New functional builds will be added when available.

## Future Builds

When functional builds are available, they will be placed in the `apk/` subdirectory with proper:
- Installation instructions
- Version documentation
- Feature descriptions
- Testing validation

## Build Information

Future builds will be properly tested and validated before inclusion.
For development setup and build instructions, see the main [README](../README.md) and [documentation](../docs/).
